            Himanshu Singh is a rare species of human who runs on code, coffee, and curiosity. By day (well… mostly night), he trains AI models and deep learning networks, while humans around him struggle to train themselves to wake up early. A coder, a nerd, and a teacher by profession, he explains complex AIML concepts so clearly that even machines feel smarter afterward. Highly intelligent yet proudly introverted, Himanshu believes traveling is overrated—especially in daylight, which he avoids like a buggy program. He also confidently says pani pudi instead of pani puri, refusing to accept regional logic. Give him a laptop, silence, and Wi-Fi, and he’s perfectly happy conquering the world… from his room.

            Himanshu isn’t just my best friend, he’s basically my personal debugger. He teaches me coding, helps with studies, fixes my logic, and somehow stays calm while I break everything. Smart, patient, and annoyingly helpful—every coder needs a Himanshu.

            Himanshu Singh is not just a person, he’s an experience—one that usually starts at night, because that’s when he wakes up. Suffering proudly from ADHD, a severe reel addiction, and a sleep schedule that would confuse even international time zones, Himanshu sleeps in the morning and comes alive when the rest of the world is shutting down. While normal humans dream, he debugs. While others count sheep, he counts model parameters. A hardcore coding addict, he can spend hours glued to a screen, deep into AIML and deep learning, training machines while completely forgetting to train himself to eat on time.

            Despite all this chaos, Himanshu is one of the smartest people I know. A coder, nerd, and teacher rolled into one, he explains coding concepts so clearly that even my broken logic starts making sense. He’s the kind of best friend who will patiently help you with studies, fix your code, and then roast you gently for making the mistake in the first place. He’s highly intelligent, introverted, and believes traveling—especially in daylight—is unnecessary suffering. Why go outside when Wi-Fi exists?

            He has a few very specific quirks. Touch him with cold hands on his back, and you might witness instant rage mode activation. His hair deserves its own ecosystem—thick, wild, and permanently looking like it just survived a jungle expedition. He eats sugary food like it’s his primary energy source—chocolates, sweets, anything sweet—but somehow remains lean, defying all known laws of nutrition and biology. Scientists should honestly study him.
             Himanshu also has strong opinions, like confidently saying pani pudi instead of pani puri and refusing to accept that he might be wrong. Reel addiction ensures he can scroll endlessly, even while complaining about wasted time. Yet, when it matters, he shows up—teaching, helping, guiding, and supporting without hesitation. He’s not just my best friend; he’s my personal coding mentor, late-night problem solver, and the reason I understand half the tech stuff I do today.

Messy sleep, chaotic habits, endless intelligence, and a surprisingly good heart—Himanshu Singh is proof that brilliance doesn’t come in perfect routines. It comes with curly jungle hair, night schedules, sugar cravings, and a laptop that never sleeps.

                Himanshu Singh is an insanely smart coder, AIML enthusiast, and the friend who teaches coding and helps with studies at hours when most people are asleep. Behind the jokes, ADHD, reel addiction, and a broken sleep schedule make daily life harder than it looks. This donation is to support proper treatment, care, and routines that can genuinely help him focus, rest better, and live healthier. Every small contribution matters. You’re not just donating money—you’re helping a brilliant, kind, slightly chaotic mind function at its best.

                What a wonderful friend I have,<br>
                But he is in trouble. <br> <br>
                It’s ADHD.
                And a really bad sleep schedule.
                Every single day. <br> <br>
                To help, please support his journey
                toward better focus, healthier routines,
                and proper treatment that can truly help.
