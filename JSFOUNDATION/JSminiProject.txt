Step 1: Do logic-only projects (NO DOM yet)

Use Node.js or browser console. Focus on thinking, not UI.

Project 1: Student Result Analyzer

Features

Input marks array

Calculate total, average

Grade using conditions

Detect pass/fail

Concepts used
Functions, loops, operators, conditionals




Project 2: Number Utilities

Create functions for:

Prime check

Factorial

Fibonacci

Even/odd filter from array

(Think of this like JS version of DSA warm-up)




Project 3: Mini Data Processor (ML-relevant)

Take an array of numbers

Normalize values

Find min/max

Count frequency

This directly connects to data preprocessing in ML later.
